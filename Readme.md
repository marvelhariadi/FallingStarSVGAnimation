# Purpose
* Animating an SVG file to make an animated asset for my UX Design portfolio.
* Dipping my toes into front-end development to herald my multitalented woman in STEM era.

# Learnings
* The "asset" does not have to be a standalone .jpg/.png/.svg/etc. file. I copy and pasted in HTML code directly into the div.

# Special Acknowledgements
Thank you claudeAI for saving my tears
